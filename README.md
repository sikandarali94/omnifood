# omnifood
contains code (html5 &amp; css3) for omnifood website -- a fake restaurant
Note: This website is better viewed locally as the css and js code has not been minified and neither have the images been compressed. This is because I want to preserve the clarity of the code, quality of the images and the fact that I have no plan on uploading this website to a server.
